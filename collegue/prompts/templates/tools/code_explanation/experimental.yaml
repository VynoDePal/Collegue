  - Identify design patterns used
  - Evaluate time/space complexity
  - Assess code quality and structure
  
  #### Layer 3: Context and Best Practices
  - How does this fit {language} conventions?
  - What improvements could be made?
  - Are there any potential issues or bugs?
  - Security considerations
  
  #### Layer 4: Educational Insights
  - Key concepts for beginners to understand
  - Advanced techniques employed
  - Learning opportunities from this code
  
  ### Focus Areas:
  {focus}
  
  ### Analysis Parameters:
  - Detail Level: {detail_level}
  - Target Audience: {audience}
  - Include Examples: {include_examples}
